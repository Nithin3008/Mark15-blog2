    <h1>Self Driving Cars</h1>
    <h2>Self-Driving cars and how do they work and how they are different from each other</h2>
    <section class="section--0 section">
        <p>So many top companies working drivrless cars or autonomous tech in cars so that the car can drive without anyone's help and there are 6 levels of autonomous driving 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>No automation</li>
            <li>Driver assitance</li>
            <li>Partial automation</li>
            <li>Conditional automation</li>
            <li>High automation</li>
            <li>Full automation</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section class="section--1 section">
        <p><span> No automation</span>: Only Driver drives the car</p>
     </section>
     
    <section class="section--2 section">
        <p><span>Driver assitance</span>: It contains some basic level features like Adaptive cruise control ex:auto cruise in cars
        </p>
     </section>
     
    <section class="section--3 section">
        <p><span> Partial automation</span>: It contains features like lane assist,self parking,driver monitoring but still driver have to drive the car ex:tesla car level 2
        </p>
     </section>
     
    <section class="section--4 section">
        <p><span>Conditional automation</span>: In these vehicles environmental detection and taking decisons based on them to help driver but here also driver intervention is importan ex:audi a8
        </p>
     </section>
     
    <section class="section--5 section">
        <p><span>High automation</span>:In these type vehicles they use some high tech sensors like lidar and radars to detect the surrounding and react here driver is not requried mostly but still an option ex:google waymo projects and arg.ai company cars
        </p>
     </section>

     <section class="section--6 section">
        <p><span>Full automation</span>:In this full autonomous driving even no steering for cars totally controlled by itself but still not in practise
        </p>
     </section>

     <p class="section">A normal consumer can purchase only upto level 2 Advanced driver-assistance systems(ADAS) cars like tesla cars and in india xuv700,mg

        <h2>How tesla and waymo implement this tech differently</h2>
        <p>Tesla was intending to go full on self driving cars and development is going on and fsd beta was rolling out for testers</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tesla still just uses only 8 cameras to detect the surroundings and they recently ditched radars but waymo depends on radars and lidars to detect 
            </li>
            <li>Tesla don't use radars and lidars because they are costly and lidars look like mini towers on roof tops of cars which might show effect on aerodynamics of cars and drag coefficent and range
            </li>
            <li>Tesla uses hydranet which is like a nerual networks to train the model which detects the objects
            </li>
            <li>Waymo works using radars,sensors and lidars to create a 360 degree world model by merging real world data from lidar and also help of high resolution maps of the road to predict the movements for surrounding cars
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="img-group">
        <p>This is how tesla cars able to see using it's 8 cameras</p>
